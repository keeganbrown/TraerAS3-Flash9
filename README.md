TRAER PHYSICS LIBRARY for AS3 (Flash 9)
========================

There are other ports of the Traer Physics Library for AS3, but out of those that I've seen, all use classes that are exclusive to Flash Player version 10.3 and above. This is a port of the Traer Physics Library that works around the need for those extra classes. Those classes (namely the vector type) perform a whole lot better, if you can publish to 10.3, then you'd be better off using another lib.
